    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The earth sausage isn't as wellknown as the other as the air or the water sausages.<br>
    Although I don't want this to deter you from trying out this amazing dish as well.<br>
    In my humble opinion this one has the best texture and flavour among all the other sausages, so give it a try.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p><ul>
        <li>High Quality Sausage Casing</li>
        <li>Food Grade Diatomaceous Earth</li>
        <li>Two Tablespoons Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Water</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p><ol>
        <li>First we have to mix the diatomaceous earth with water that is half it's volume</li>
        <li>After mixing it should have a gooey texture</li>
        <li>Fill the casing with your mixing product and tie the open end</li>
        <li>Oil your pan and start cooking the sausage on high heat</li>
        <li>Cook until the sausage is rock hard</li>
        <li>Your sausage should be ready to eat</li>
