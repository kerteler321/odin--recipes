    <h1>The Fire Sausage</h1>
    <p><img src="./images/fire-sausage.jpg" alt="The Finished Product" width="700"></p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The fire sausage is the least creative among all the sausages in this website.<br>
    It sort of resembles an ordinary sausage that's on fire. This is the main reason why it's not as loved as the other ones on this list.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p><ul>
        <li>High Quality Sausage Casing</li>
        <li>Fireball Cinnamon Whisky</li>
        <li>Main Sausage Filling of Your Choosing</li>
        <li>Two Tablespoons Olive Oil</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Fill the sausage casing with your filling(you might wanna use a meat grinder depending on your filling choice)</li>
        <li>Also add fireball into the casing and tie the open end</li>
        <li>Oil your pan and put the stove on high heat</li>
        <li>Put your sausage on the pan and start cooking(be careful not to start a fire)</li>
        <li>Cook until the filling inside is ready to be eaten</li>
        <li>Take the sausage off the heat</li>
        <li>As always you can present it however you like but I'd recommend putting it in a bun with more fireball and lighting it on fire</li>
    </ol></p>
